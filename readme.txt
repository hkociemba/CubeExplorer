Version History:

2019-10-07  Cube Explorer 5.15
            - Autorun did not handle the number of allowed threads correctly.
            - Option to sort the cubes in the main window by the cube ID.

2019-10-07  Cube Explorer 5.14
            - The search for incomplete cube did not work correctly when using slice turns. The fixed version
              also has the possibility to exclude faces in this case now.

2017-23-04  Cube Explorer 5.13
            - Fixed some issues with Run|Start Autorun feature
	    - Fixed issues with the display when using Cube Explorer with multiple monitors. 
	    - Timing problems with the webservers ?scanX command which gave wrong output. Fixed.
	    - Symmetry information was not updated for selected cube when switching to the symmetry tab. Fixed.  

2014-08-29  Cube Explorer 5.12
            -Two-phase-algorithm for QTM with center-twisted cubes needed a higher
             value for the maximal maneuver length.
            -Two-phase-algorithm option dialog needed higher values for the automatic
             search stop value.       


2014-08-26  Cube Explorer 5.10
            -Version for the Half Turn Metric HTM and Quarter Turn Metric QTM supplied.
            -"Exactly this Symmetry/Antisymmetry" checkboxes in the Symmetry Editor
            -Text in messagebox for Huge Solver adopted to current hardware and software 


2013-04-28  Cube Explorer 5.01
            -Loading maneuvers from file did not set correct maneuverlength. Bug fixed.
            -Maneuvers like D'S were interpreted wrong in the "Apply" box. Bug fixed.
            -Possibility to scramble only edges or corners
            -Possibility to multiply a cube in the Main Window with the cube in the Facelet Editor.
            -When loading a maneuver file, empty lines generated an id-Cube. Now these lines are ignored.
            -On Webcam Tab Hue, Sat and Val now are grayed out in interactive mode, which is consistent with
             the display.
            -Save Interactive/Automatic Webcam settings for next program start.


2010-03-22  Cube Explorer 5.00
            -Possibility to use *slice moves* in all parts of the program.
		 This involved changes at many locations of the source code.
             Hopefully I did not forget too many dependencies.
            -The Delphi built in Random Generator is poor and gives only a small
             fraction of  all possible cubes. I replaced it with the
             Mersenne-Twister MT 19937.
            -A basic interface for robot builders who do not want to use the
             webserver interface: alt-s triggers the "scan" button and alt-v 
             triggers the "Solve Scanned Cube" button, ctrl-f saves the computed
             maneuver to the file ctrlFsave.txt. There are possibilities to send
             these keyboard commands to the application.
            -The webserver dialog was simplified. You just set the port and 
             the option to save the result to a file.
            -There were some issues with the parity of the center orientations
             when solving partially defined cubes. Bug fixed.

            -Some changes ins Search routine of Two-Phase-Algorithm for cubes with twisted centers
             improves performance.
            -WCA scramble menu simplified  

2008-08-12  Cube Explorer 4.50

            configuration possibilities than the applet I used before.

             and the webserver activated.
            -Removed the RAM-size check when loading the Huge Optimal Solver because
             it was reported that it fails with RAM-sizes > 4GB.   

2008-03-22  Cube Explorer 4.30
            -Complete redesign of the webcam interface. Now Uses the DirectShow 
             interface instead of the outdated WfW (Video for Windows) interface.

           -Helpfile updated. 

2006-10-23 Cube Explorer 4.00
           -Support for solving incomplete cubes is implemented:
